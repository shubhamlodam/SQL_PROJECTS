ðŸŽ¯Analyzing the World Population

In this project, you will use the dataset by CIA World Factbook and explore how the world population
spreads across different countries.
The data has information from only 261 different countries.
Dataset contains 11 rows and 262 columns like id, code, area, population, birth_rate, death_rate,
migration_rate, population_growth.

Approach/Project Idea :
You will learn how to use SQL to answer the following analytical questions:
1. Which country has the highest population?
2. Which country has the least number of people?
3. Which country is witnessing the highest population growth?
4. Which country has an extraordinary number for the population?
5. Which is the most densely populated country in the world?
