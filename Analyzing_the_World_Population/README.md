In this project, you will use the dataset by CIA World Factbook and explore how the world population
spreads across different countries.
The data has information from only 261 different countries.
Dataset contains 11 rows and 262 columns like id, code, area, population, birth_rate, death_rate,
migration_rate, population_growth.
